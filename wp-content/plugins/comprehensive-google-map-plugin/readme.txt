== Description ==

A simple and intuitive, yet elegant and fully documented Google map plugin that installs as a widget and a short code. No limited plugin editions or limited functionality! This is the full version of this free and premium plugin, which comes packed with useful features: 

* Intuitive and user friendly interface, which makes it very easy to configure Google map. No complex configuration options. Facebook style interactive interface for managing multiple map markers. OpenStreetMap imagery available
* Over 250 amazingg custom marker icons to choose from!

* Help tooltips enabled, which makes your configuration hassle free
* Google-like directions - driving and walking, distance shown in miles or KM, avoid tolls and highways options, direction print functionality
* Info window can display marker's street view within itself.
* Plugin is fully documented. If help tooltips are not enough, you can always refer to the full documentation about each of the settings
* Short-code builder available, which integrated with post/page editor. In other words, you do not need
manually to type the short-code in the editor (But you can if you want to).

Please note: 
Although I try my best to release a bug-free code, one or two may slip through. It would be so cool and I would really appreciate it if you would report any bugs to me first at http://initbinder.com/comprehensive-google-map-plugin, before reporting the plugin to be broken. I am quick to respond. 
Thanks!

== Installation ==

Install this plugin by downloading and unzipping the ZIP archive into your plugins directory (/wp-content/plugins). Alternatively, you can upload the ZIP archive using Wordpress upload function. Activate the plugin in order to start using it.

To use the widget, simply drag the 'AZ :: Google Map' widget into a sidebar. Please note, your theme has to be widget-enabled. To change the styles of the contact form, open style.css file in the plugin editor in Wordpress. The short code builder can be found under the post/page editor. To access documentation please find "Google Map" link, under the "Settings" in your Wordpress admin panel.

Do you have a question or a feature request? Sure, drop me a line here: http://initbinder.com/comprehensive-google-map-plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. Where can I find the short code builder?<br />
After plugin installation look for the 'Google Map' menu item on the left hand side of your WP admin. The 'Shortcode builder' item is just there. After generating the short code, copy the contents of the popup and paste int your post/page.

2. How fast can you have a look at my bug?<br />
Well, I always check emails on the go, so my response times are amazingly short and fast. I always try to reply. Having said that, not always I can dive into the code. It can take me up to a few hours when I reach my laptop and Internet connection :)

3. I have dragged/scrolled/pulled my map to a direction, messed up my zoom view, how can I get get all my markers in view again with the original zoom?<br />
Just click once somewhere on the map

4. The map appears empty with "loading" image or just gray square why is that?
Please check the following when adding marker locations: 
[a] In the shortcode builder, did you add marker loaction(s) and clicked the 'Add' button before clicking 'Send to Editor'?
[b] In the widget, did you add marker loaction(s) and clicked the 'Add' button before clicking 'Save'?
Please revisit and reconfigure your widget or shortcode configuration. The map requires at least one marker location to be added.

5. Where is plugin documentation?<br />
After plugin activation, look at the left hand side menu of WP admin, look for "Google Map" item

== Screenshots ==

1. Help tooltip in action
2. Documentation page
3. Shortcode builder page
4. Generated short code in the editor
5. Facebook style interactive interface for map markers with custom icons and text
6. Direction panel
7. Markers info window with the direction and street view
8. Street view in the marker's infer window
9. When having marker Geo mashup, you can display in the info bubble marker's original post and post content excerpt instead of normally address and lat/long
