With this plugin you can control the indexing behaviour of search engines for any post or page.

== Description ==

This plugin will give you full control of the `meta robots` tag for each post or page. `meta robots` have a direct influence to the indexing behaviour of search engines.
After activation you will find it as a WordPress typical meta box on the edit page in admin area.

From a dropdown menu you can choose the following options:

* index, follow
* index, nofollow
* noindex, follow
* noindex, nofollow

By creating an new post/page the default value is automatically set to `index, follow` without any user input. Categories, tags, and archiv are set to `noindex, follow`. Search results, 404 and others to `noindex, nofollow`.
